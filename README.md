# bash-script-setup

I wrote a program that set's up you ~/bin and puts that bin in your path if they are not already there, then it build a simple hello script. (Must have node installed.)

`git clone https://github.com/JimmyMcBride/bash-script-setup.git`

`cd bash-script-setup`

`node index.js`

`hello`
